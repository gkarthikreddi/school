## Statistics

Average - Three types
1. Mean : Sum of all events / number of events
2. Median : Middle value
3. Mode : Most occurred

Concepts:
1. Range : (highest value - lowest value)
2. Interquartile Range : mid of right part - mid of left part
3. Mid range : (Lowest + Highest)/2
4. Variance (sigma square)
5. Standard deviation (squareroot(sigma))
6. Sample Standard Deviation : (n - 1)

Other:
1. Mean Absolute Deviation : Variance without the square

### Z-Score
How may (sigma) away from (mean)\
It is useful in Normal Distribution

### Normal Distribution
Empirical Rule : 68 - 95 - 99.7

## Linear Regression and Correlation

### Correlation co-efficient(r)

**-1 <= r <= 1**

### Regression
1. Residual : Actual - Predicted
2. Least square Regression 
3.  m(slope) = r * (sy/sx)

## Random Variable 
1. Discrete Variable : Precise
2. Continuous Variable : Infinite
3. Expected Value(Mean)
4. Variance : (difference b/w mean whole square times P{X})
5. Probability Density Function : Area under graph
6. Binomial Random variable : 
	1. Outcome is either successful of failure
	2. Each trail is independent
	3. Fixed number of trails
	4. probability (p) on each trail remains constant
